Gamesense VS Code Highlighting with Panorama and FFI support

Uhh, FFI somewhere down the track? feel free to improve, this is shitty af, make it better,

Check the markdown.tmLanguage.json for the begin and end regex strings you can experiment with.

This repository should go in:
%userprofile%\.vscode\extensions

example: %userprofile%\.vscode\extensions\csmit195.gamesense-1.0.0\package.json

Dope, please help.
